# Tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe, a timeless battle of X's and O's, is played on a 3x3 grid.
A game loop can be used to handle the flow of the game. 
The game board can be represented using a two-dimensional array, with each element representing a square on the board. 
The elements of the array can be updated when a player clicks on a square, either with an "X" or an "O
This loop can be implemented using a function that is called after each player's turn. 
The function can check the game board for a win or a draw and handle the game's end state.
